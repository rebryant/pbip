*** Example of PBIP proof derived (by hand) from application of RUP rules

* Proof goal is to add C = [2 x1   1  x2   1  x3 >= 2] via RUP
* from input clauses C1, C2, and C3
* ~C = [2 ~x1  1 ~x2  1 ~x3 >= 3]
* which propagates ~x1, giving rho_0 = [1 ~x1 >= 1]

*** Input constraints
* C1
i 1  x1   2  x2   1 ~x3 >= 2 ;
* C1 propagates x2, giving rho_1 = [1 ~x1  1  x2 >= 2]

* C2
i 1 ~x1   1 ~x2   2  x3 >= 2 ;
* C2 propagates x3, giving rho_2 = [1 ~x1  1  x2  1  x3 >= 3]

* C3
i 1  x1   2 ~x2   2 ~x3 >= 3 ;
* C3 yields contradiction

* C4.  Makes formula unsatisfiable
i 1 ~x1           1 ~x3 >= 2 ;

* C5.  Target clause
k 2  x1   1  x2   1  x3 >= 2 ; 

* C6.  Propagate ~x1
A 1 ~x1                 >= 1 ; -5

* C7.  Propagate x2
A         1  x2         >= 1 ; 1 6

* C8.  Keep x2, Propagate x3
A         1  x2   1  x3 >= 2 ; 2 7

* C9.  Contradiction
A                       >= 1 ; 3 8
* C10.  Target clause conflicts with C4
* The target clause conflicts with clause C4
a                       >= 1 ; 4 5
