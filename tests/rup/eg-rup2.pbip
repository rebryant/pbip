* Example of PBIP proof derived (by hand) from application of RUP rules
* Proof goal is to add C = [2 x1   1  x2   1  x3 >= 2] via RUP
* from input clauses C1, C2, and C3
* !C = [2 !x1  1 !x2  1 !x3 >= 3]
* which propagates !x1, giving rho_0 = [1 !x1 >= 1]
* Input constraints
* C1
i 1 x1 2 x2 -1 x3 >= 1 ; 1 2 3 4 5 6
* C1 propagates x2, giving rho_1 = [1 !x1  1  x2 >= 2]
* C2
i -1 x1 -1 x2 2 x3 >= 0 ; 7 8 9 10 11
* C2 propagates x3, giving rho_2 = [1 !x1  1  x2  1  x3 >= 3]
* C3
i 1 x1 -2 x2 -1 x3 >= 0 ; 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
* C3 yields contradiction
* C4.  Makes formula unsatisfiable
i -1 x1 -1 x3 >= 0 ; 19 20 21 22
* Proof
* Conflict clause !rho_2
a 1 x1 -1 x2 -1 x3 >= -1 ; 3
* Conflict clause !rho_1
a 1 x1 -1 x2 >= 0 ; 2 5
* Conflict clause !rho_0
a 1 x1 >= 1 ; 1 6
* Target clause
a 2 x1 1 x2 1 x3 >= 2 ; 7
* Completion
* The target clause conflicts with clause C4
a >= 1 ; 4 8
