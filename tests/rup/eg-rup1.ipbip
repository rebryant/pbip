*** Example of PBIP proof derived (by hand) from application of RUP rules

* Proof goal is to add C = [1 !x1   1  x2  >= 1]
* from input clauses C1 and C2
* !C = [1 x1   1 !x2  >= 2]
* which propagates x1 and !x2 giving rho_0 = !C

*** Input constraints
* C1
i 1  x1   2  x2   3 !x3 >= 3 ;
* C1 propagates !x3, giving rho_1 = [1 x1   1 !x2   1 !x3  >= 3]

* C2
i 1  x1   1  x2   2  x3 >= 2 ;
* C2 yields contradiction

* C3.  Makes formula unsatisfiable
i 1  x1   1 !x2         >= 2 ;

*** Proof
* Conflict clause rho_1
a 1 !x1   1  x2   1  x3 >= 1 ; 2
* Conflict clause rho_0 = target clause
a 1 !x1   1  x2         >= 1 ; 1 4


*** Completion
* The target clause directly conflicts with clause C3
a                       >= 1 ; 3 5
